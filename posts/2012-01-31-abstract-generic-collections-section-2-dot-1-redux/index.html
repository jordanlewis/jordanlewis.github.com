      <p>At the end of my last post, I mentioned that I ended up reusing Scala&rsquo;s build-in
List collection to implement the exercises instead of writing a generic abstract
Stack and sample implementations of those. Since then, I&rsquo;ve spent some time
learning about how to implement generic collections in Scala. I came up with
a Stack trait, <em>a la</em> Okasaki&rsquo;s Stack signature, and three implementations: the
first two are straightforward translations of the SML structures given in the
book, and the third is a more Scala-idiomatic implementation.</p>
<p>On an organizational note, I&rsquo;ve also started a
<a href="https://github.com/jordanlewis/PFDScala">PFDScala repository</a> on GitHub for
this blog series, so I can have a centralized place to put all of the code I
write for the exercises and examples. I&rsquo;ll still put the relevant snippets in
gists so I can embed them here.</p>
<h2 id="a-generic-trait-for-stacks">A Generic Trait for Stacks <a href="#a-generic-trait-for-stacks" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h2>
<p>Scala traits are very powerful. They&rsquo;re basically like mixin classes from Ruby,
in that your class can extend from multiple traits without having the troubles
that plague C++-style multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>Abstract traits can be used like Java interfaces. This is just what we need to
write a generic interface for Stacks:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jordanlewis/1709179.js"></script>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with Scala, this is similar to a Java interface or
a SML signature: we&rsquo;re defining a type-parameterized trait/interface/signature
with a bunch of method signatures that classes which extend this trait must
implement themselves. What&rsquo;s up with the weird type annotations, though?</p>
<p>In Scala, annotating a type parameter with <code>+</code> marks it as a covariant type
parameter. This means that if we have a type <code>C[+T]</code>, a type with a single
covariant type parameter, and if type <code>A</code> is a subtype of type <code>B</code>, then type
<code>C[A]</code> is a subtype of <code>C[B]</code>. We can similarly annotate a type parameter with
<code>-</code> for the opposite effect.</p>
<p>The <code>&gt;:</code> type operator is the supertype relationship: the type on the left of
it has to be a supertype of the type on the right of it.</p>
<p>So why do we need to annotate our types like this here? In Scala, by default,
types are invariant in their type parameters. This means if we had a
<code>List[Integer]</code>, and <code>List</code>'s type parameter was invariant, then that list
would not be a subtype of a <code>List[Number]</code>, even though it seems like it would
be fine because a <code>List</code> of <code>Integers</code> is just a specialized <code>List</code> of
<code>Numbers</code>. The same thing goes for our <code>Stack</code> type, so we mark its type
parameter up as covariant.</p>
<p>However, to keep compile-time type checking sound, Scala has to impose some
restrictions on the types of methods in classes with covariant type parameters,
due to the problem of mutability: a mutable array of type <code>T</code> is actually
<em>contravariant</em> in its type parameter, because if you had an <code>Array</code> of type
<code>Any</code>, updating one of its cells to be a subtype of <code>Any</code> like <code>String</code> is not
always legal. So, in our <code>Stack</code> example, we can no longer simply say</p>
<pre><code>def cons(x: T) : Stack[T]
</code></pre><p>because the <code>x</code> is appearing in a <em>contravariant</em> position, meaning that it has
the potential to mutate state in a way that could break type safety.</p>
<p>Luckily, we can get around this problem of contraviariant position by imposing
a bound on the type of cons&rsquo;s parameter: we say</p>
<pre><code>def cons(x: U &gt;: T) : Stack[U]
</code></pre><p>to ensure that the input type of cons is a supertype of the stack&rsquo;s type. This
prevents any type safety issues caused by the potential contravariance of the
formal parameter, and allows users to generalize the type of a <code>Stack</code> by consing
a more general type onto it. For example, one could cons a String onto a
<code>Stack</code>[Int] and get out a <code>Stack</code>[Any].</p>
<h2 id="implementation-1-using-builtin-lists-as-the-backing-store">Implementation 1: Using builtin Lists as the backing store <a href="#implementation-1-using-builtin-lists-as-the-backing-store" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h2>
<p>This class uses the builtin List implementation to provide the underlying
storage for the <code>Stack</code>. It also uses Scala&rsquo;s <em>companion object</em> feature to
provide a static factory method for creating new <code>ListStack</code>s.</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jordanlewis/1709271.js"></script>

<h2 id="implementation-2-using-a-custom-list-case-class-as-the-backing-store">Implementation 2: Using a custom List case class as the backing store <a href="#implementation-2-using-a-custom-list-case-class-as-the-backing-store" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h2>
<p>This class uses a custom implementation of <code>List</code> as the backing store. It&rsquo;s
the same idea as the first one, except we use a set of case classes to match on
instead of just wrapping <code>List</code>'s functions.</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jordanlewis/1709288.js"></script>

<p>This shows off Scala&rsquo;s case classes a little bit: they&rsquo;re just like datatypes
in SML, except a bit more verbose to specify. The abstract class <code>LIST</code> is like
the name of the datatype, and the case classes that inherit from it are like
the datatype&rsquo;s constructors. Making <code>LIST</code> <em>sealed</em> restricts classes from
extending it unless they&rsquo;re in the same file: this allows the compiler to detect
non-exhaustive matches.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-3-implementing-the-stack-functions-within-case-classes">Implementation 3: Implementing the <code>Stack</code> functions within case classes <a href="#implementation-3-implementing-the-stack-functions-within-case-classes" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h2>
<p>This implementation is a bit different from the other two: instead of storing
the actual <code>Stack</code> data as a data member inside of a single <code>StackImpl</code> class,
this puts the implementation inside of case classes that extend the
implementation class, which is made abstract.</p>
<p>This strategy seems the most idiomatic of the implementations I wrote. It
defines its own internal datatype like the custom <code>List</code> implementation,
without the mess of having to match on each of the cases of the custom <code>List</code>
every time it&rsquo;s necessary to operate on the data. I think it produces the most
compact and readable code out of all three implementations.</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jordanlewis/1709315.js"></script>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h2>
<p>That was a long-winded post for what was just defining a simple custom
collection interface and a few simple implementations. Again, all of this code is available in the
<a href="https://github.com/jordanlewis/PFDScala">PFDScala GitHub repo</a>. Next time
we&rsquo;ll proceed with the next section, 2.2. Hopefully it will be easier to
implement the examples and exercise solutions with the improved understanding
of Scala&rsquo;s type system that I gathered by writing this post.</p>
