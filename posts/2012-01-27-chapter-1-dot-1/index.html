      <p>This is the inaugural post of the PFDS series.</p>
<p>Section 2.1 discusses the ramifications of implementing lists and stacks in a
functional and immutable manner. Using the operation of <strong>list catenation</strong>
as a motivator, Okasaki introduces the idea of data sharing. We see that to
catenate two lists, we can share the second list, which doesn&rsquo;t get modified,
but must copy all of the nodes in the first list just to modify the last one.</p>
<p>In Scala, the function catenate on the built-in list type looks like the
following:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jordanlewis/1692508.js"></script>

<p>Updating a single element of the list is similar. We have to copy all of the
elements in the list up to the element to be updated, and then we can point the
tail of the element we updated to the pre-existing tail of the old element,
thus sharing as much data as possible.</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jordanlewis/1692539.js"></script>

<h3 id="exercise-21">Exercise 2.1 <a href="#exercise-21" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>This exercise is straightforward: we must write a function that takes a generic
list and returns a list of all of the suffix lists of the input list,
from longest to shortest. We must show that this function operates in linear
time and linear space with respect to the size of the input list.</p>
<p>Since no elements are being updated, it&rsquo;s easy to see that all we have to do is
return a new list whose elements are every cons cell in the input list. This
is O(n) in time, as we are performing one cons operation for each element in the
input list, and O(n) in space, as we&rsquo;re saving one cons cell per cons cell in
the input list.</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/jordanlewis/1692330.js"></script>

<p>This was a pretty simple section, serving mainly as a refresher course in
functional programming fundamentals.</p>
<p>For this post, I reused Scala&rsquo;s built-in List type to implement the exercise
and example functions. I had intended to define my own abstract generic Stack,
and show how it can be implemented with either the build-in List type or a set
of case classes Nil and Cons, like Okasaki does using Standard ML. However, I&rsquo;m
still a Scala novice, and I ran into some difficulties with the type system
that go over my head at this point. I plan to revisit this at a later date once
I&rsquo;ve learned a little bit more about Scala&rsquo;s type system.</p>
